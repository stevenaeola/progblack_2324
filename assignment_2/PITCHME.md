# Requirements and Assessment Criteria

---

## Learning log

- Make at least four separate entries reasonably spaced over a period of at least six weeks
- The entries can either be separate files or different sections within the same file. 
- They should be written using Markdown and stored in a private repository on GitHub. 
- You need to commit and push each entry as you make it so that the dates of the entries are correctly recorded in git. 
- You can include images and external links.

---

For each entry identify

- What you have done (to learn your skill and contribute to your project)
- What you have learned
- Any changes to your goals (or what your initial goals are for the first entry)
- Next step(s) to achieve your goals 

The learning log should have a maximum total word count of 1500 words, as measured by the [Microsoft VS Code Word Count plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.wordcount) and have a reasonable balance between the entries.

---

### Assessment criteria (10% each)
- Number, timing and word count of entries (use of git)
- Appropriate development and monitoring of goals
- Evidence of increased understanding
- Evidence of collaboration
- Evidence of criticality about your own actions and assumptions

---

## Guide for learners

Based on your experience, write a Markdown document which explains to somebody else how to master the skill you have been learning. 

You don't need to explain the details, but identify and pull together useful resources.

---

## Guide for learners structure

- Motivation (10%): Why learn it?
- Background (10%): What do you need to know before starting? Include links to material to catch up. Make it clear who your target audience is
- Learning materials (10%): Provide appropriate links to external resources with commentary
- Evaluation (10%): How useful is the skill, compared with the effort of learning it? What similar alternatives are there?
- Presentation (10%)

---

The presentation mark (10%) will be awarded on the basis of

  - formatting in ([GitHub flavored](https://GitHub.GitHub.com/gfm/)) Markdown
  - choice of media (images, video)
  - clear writing style appropriate for audience

---

 The guide for learners should have a maximum total word count of 1500 words, as measured by the [Microsoft VS Code Word Count plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.wordcount) 

---

# Submission

- Your learning log and your guide for learners should be held within a single private repository on GitHub. 
- In the repository you should include a README file including a link to the repository on GitHub. 
- You should submit the entire content of the repository as a zip file.

---

## Submission repository

- The repository on GitHub must be accessible by me (username stevenaeola).
- Allow access to the repository through Settings - Manage Access - Invite a collaborator. 
- If you do not allow access you will lose marks. 
- Note that this does not affect the access to any code you may write, which would most likely be in a public repository.
